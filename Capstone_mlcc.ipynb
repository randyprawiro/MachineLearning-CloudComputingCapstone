    "**1. Business Domain Understanding** \n",
    "\n",
    "Customer Churn is defined as the event when customers decide to stop subscribing to a service provided by a company. The telecommunications industry, in particular, suffers from a high degree of customer churn. This is due to a myriad of different factors. Some of the reasons that cause customers to churn in the industry are poor service quality, competitors offering customers with better deals, and the low barrier to switching to other providers. \n",
    "Customer churn is a very important indicator of the liquidity of a telecom company, as its short-term profit is measured by the revenue gained from the periodic cash flows obtained from subscription contracts. The cutoff of these regular subscriptions would mean losing the company's primary means of financing its operations and repaying its short-term debt. Therefore, it can be concluded that minimizing the loss of regular customer subscriptions (minimizing churn) is of the utmost importance for a telecommunications company.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Business Problem Formulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The given dataset shows that a significant amount of customers ended up churning from a telecom company. By implementing a machine learning classification model to predict whether its customers will churn or not, the company could reduce the rate of churn of its customers and reduce their losses resulting from churn. The company could also set up preventive measures to stop customers from churning, such as delivering targeted retention programs or offering personalized discounts or offers based on a given customer's characteristics. In addition to that, the company would have the benefit of automating its churn identification process, instead of identifying which customers will churn manually. This results in the improvement of the time and cost efficiency of customer retention decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Analytical Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "The telecom company wants to prevent customers from churning. \n",
    "Customers who are predicted to churn will be offered special discounts or offers for cheaper or better quality services in order to prevent them from churning. \n",
    "The historical data was collected from about 5000 of the company's customers about the types of subcriptions the customers were subscribed to, data about their subscription transactions, and whether the customer churned their subscriptions by the end of the observation period.\n",
    "The company is interested to know which customers will stop their subscriptions based on the features provided in this dataset. By classifying customers into those who will churn and those who won't, we could target customer retention programs to customers who are predicted to churn, and continue serving customers who aren't predicted to churn as usual. By doing this, we can prevent customers from churning without incurring too much unnecessary retention costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains observations for around 5000 of the company's customers. This project aims to build an ML model that can predict if the customer will churn from the company or not based on certain features provided in the dataset.\n",
    "This project aims to simulate the role of a data scientist in the telecommunications company.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Evaluation Metric**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to identify as many churning customers as possible (higher recall), at the cost of having a bias towards falsely identifying non-churning customers as churning (lower precision). As the cost of misclassifying non-churning customers as churning is non-zero and the cost of misclassifying churning customers as not churning is higher, the evaluation metric should be f2, the weighted average of recall and precision with recall having the larger weight. This is done with assumption that the cost incurred for implementing customer retention strategies is lower than the cost incurred by customer churn. This is assumed from the premise that the profits gained from a customer subscription should ideally exceed the retention cost of targeting the particular customer, in order for the retention efforts to be worth while.\n",
    "Therefore, we will focus more on the model's recall score because we are more intersted in minimizing false negatives than we are in minimizing false positives for the positive class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **False Negative (FN):** if a customer is predicted not to churn, but he/she actually did. \n",
    "- **False Positive (FP):** if a customer is predicted to churn, but he/she actually did not. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cost of FN:** we lost a customer to churn.\n",
    "- **Cost of FP:** We incurred unnecessary cost from targeting a non-churning customer."

    "The tuned XGBoost model had a recall score of around 91%. This means the model was able to predict 91% of all churn cases. The total loss from churn was $96,532, which means we could save up to $87,844 from customer churn and mitigate our loss from churn to only $8,688. The downside of this is the model would misclassify 38% (1 - negative class recall) of customers who didn't churn as churning. However, this is still a preferable case, as the cost of customer retention (serving discounted prices or offering cheaper alternative services) are negligible compared to the loss of revenue as a result of churn.\n",

    "We could estimate the expected loss from churn misclassification, which is the number of False Positives (270) times the total cost of offering discounts or cheaper services to customers who didn't need them, which is $13.10 as was determined during EDA. So the total expected loss from False Positives (type 1 error) would have been $3,497.7 or about $3,500.0. Add this amount to our initial False Negative cost (type 2 error) of $8,688 and we have a total loss of $12,185 from FP and FN. This leaves us with net revenue saved = total potential revenue - revenue lost from churn - cost of unnecessary retention ($96,532 - $8,688 - $3.497 = $84,347).\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of deploying this model is we would be able to reduce our costs as a result of churn by 87.38% ($84,347/$96,532), and reduce the churn rate from 26.54% to only 2.47% (24/(24+234+443+270)).\n",
    "\n",
    "What is recommended once we have our predictions is to deliver personalized retention strategies for customers who were predicted to churn. It is also recommended to invest in the company's services that caused high churn rates, such as the fiber optic internet service, paperless billing, and the month-to-month subscription plan. The amount that should be spent on customer retention programs should also be lower than the potential revenue that could be saved from churn. This means the cost of serving discounted prices and offering different or cheaper services must not exceed the expected revenue saved from churn, or else it is not worth conducting churn prevention because the total cost to keep the customers is higher than the cost of losing them."

    "XGBoost combines the predictions from multiple decision trees to make final predictions. Each tree is trained sequentially, where each subsequent tree corrects errors made by the previous ones. This ensemble approach results in a highly complex model structure that can be difficult to interpret directly. XGBoost trees are also typically deep (many levels) and wide (many branches). This complexity allows XGBoost to capture intricate patterns in the data but also increases the model's opacity. XGBoost excels in predictive accuracy but can be challenging to interpret due to its inherent complexity. Here’s where SHAP comes into play: it provides a way to break down the black-box nature of XGBoost models into understandable components."

The length of each bar indicates the magnitude and direction of the impact each feature has on the model's prediction for the specific observation i. Positive SHAP values indicate features pushing the prediction higher (towards a 'churn' prediction), while negative values indicate features pushing the prediction lower (towards a 'not churn' prediction). For observation 20, not having a month-to-month contract contributed significantly towards a 'not churn' prediction, and having a 98.25 monthly charge contributed significantly towards a 'churn' prediction for the customer."

    "The generated summary plot provides a comprehensive overview of feature importance and the impact of each feature on churn predictions in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each feature is represented by a horizontal bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The length of the bar indicates the magnitude of the SHAP values. Longer bars indicate features that have a higher impact on model predictions.\n",

    "* The color of the bar reflects the average value of the feature across the dataset. Features with higher values (towards red) or lower values (towards blue) are visually distinguished.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we take a look at the \"Contract__Month-to-month\" feature, you will see that it has roughly the same amount of high and low values indicated with similar feature importance distributions on both sides. This means that higher values of the month-to-month contract feature contributes significantly towards a 'churn' prediction. In a similar manner, lower values of the month-to-month contract feature contributes significantly towards a 'not churn' prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a similar manner, if we take a look at the monthly charges feature, there are more higher values around higher shap values than there are lower ones. This means that higher monthly charges contribute positively towards a 'churn' prediction, whereas lower monthly charges contribute towards 'not churn' predictions, with less feature importance compared to the contribution of higher monthly charges values towards 'churn' predictions."
